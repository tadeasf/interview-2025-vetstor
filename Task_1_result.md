- `getAnimalVaccinationHistory(animalId)` - All vaccinations for specific animal
- `processNewRecords()` - Trigger processing of new health records

**Dependencies:** Ticket 4

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. **Extraction**: Read from Supabase `raw_records` table
2. **Processing**: Apply vaccination/castration extraction algorithms
3. **Storage**: Save processed data in chosen persistence layer
4. **API**: Serve data via tRPC endpoints
5. **Frontend**: Display data in React components with shadcn/ui

### Technology Stack
- **Database**: Supabase (read-only access)
- **Backend**: Next.js App Router with tRPC
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TanStack Query
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Deployment**: Vercel/Netlify

### Key Assumptions
- Health records are primarily in Czech language
- Vaccination data is contained in `raw_record.report` text field
- Animal identification is via `pet_id` field
- Date information comes from `visit_date` field
- Text parsing will require fuzzy matching due to medical terminology variations

### Success Metrics
- Extraction accuracy > 90% on sample data
- Application loads animal list in < 2 seconds
- Detail page displays vaccination history in < 1 second
- Mobile-responsive design works on iOS/Android
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
