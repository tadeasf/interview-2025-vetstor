# Task 2 Implementation Comments

## Project Overview
I built a vaccination tracking system that extracts vaccination data from Czech veterinary health records and presents it through a modern React web application.

## Assumptions about Data Shape and Edge Cases

### Data Structure Assumptions
- **Primary Data Source**: The `raw_records` table contains health records with a `report` field containing Czech medical text
- **Language**: Medical records are primarily in Czech with some Latin medical terminology
- **Date Source**: Vaccination dates are derived from the `visit_date` field rather than parsed from text
- **Animal Identification**: Animals are uniquely identified by `pet_id`

### Edge Cases Handled
1. **Multiple Vaccinations per Visit**: The algorithm can extract multiple vaccinations from a single visit record
2. **Typos and Abbreviations**: Fuzzy matching for vaccine names handles common misspellings and doctor shorthand
3. **Missing Data**: Graceful handling when no vaccination information is found
4. **Invalid Records**: Data validation ensures malformed records don't crash the system
5. **Mixed Language Records**: Support for both Czech and some Latin terminology

### Assumptions About Medical Terminology
- Czech terms: "vakcinace", "očkování", "vakcinoval", "vakcinování"
- Common vaccine names: Tricat, Nobivac, Feligen, Canigen, Biocan, DHPPI, Rabies
- Compound vaccines: "Nobivac DHPPI+L4", "Biocan Novel DHPPi/L4"

## How I Identified "Latest Vaccination"

### Latest Vaccination Logic
1. **Date-based Sorting**: All vaccinations for an animal are sorted by `vaccination_date` in descending order
2. **Most Recent Selection**: The first vaccination in the sorted list is considered the "latest"
3. **Null Handling**: Animals with no vaccinations show "Žádná vakcinace" (No vaccination)

### Confidence Scoring
Each extracted vaccination includes a confidence score (0-1) based on:
- Presence of multiple vaccination terms in text
- Specific vaccine name matches
- Text length (very short text reduces confidence)
- Base confidence of 0.8 for clear matches

## Libraries/Services Used and Why

### Backend Technology Stack
- **tRPC**: Type-safe API layer providing end-to-end TypeScript types
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition
- **Supabase JS**: Database client for reading health records
- **Next.js App Router**: Modern full-stack React framework

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **TanStack Query**: Powerful data fetching with caching and background updates
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautiful, accessible UI components built on Radix UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Lucide React**: Consistent icon library

### Why These Choices
1. **Type Safety**: tRPC + TypeScript ensures API contracts are enforced at compile time
2. **Performance**: TanStack Query provides excellent caching and background refetching
3. **User Experience**: shadcn/ui components provide professional, accessible interface
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, type checking, and modern tooling
5. **Scalability**: Clean separation of concerns allows easy feature additions

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Real-time Processing**: Vaccinations are extracted on-demand rather than pre-processed
2. **In-memory Caching**: 5-minute cache for processed data to reduce API calls
3. **Batch Processing**: Option to process all records at once for initial data loading

### Frontend Architecture
1. **Client-side Rendering**: Better interactivity and user experience
2. **Component-based**: Reusable UI components for maintainability
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Loading states and error handling throughout

### API Design
1. **RESTful Operations**: Clear endpoints for different data operations
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and retry mechanisms
3. **Performance**: Efficient queries and minimal data transfer

## Trade-offs and Next Steps

### Current Trade-offs
1. **Processing Speed vs. Accuracy**: Chose higher accuracy over raw speed for medical data
2. **Memory vs. Storage**: In-memory caching instead of persistent storage for simplicity
3. **Client-side vs. Server-side**: Client-side processing for better interactivity

### What I Would Do With More Time

#### Algorithm Improvements
1. **Machine Learning**: Train a model on medical texts for better extraction accuracy
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Use Czech NLP libraries for better text understanding
3. **Medical Ontology**: Integrate with veterinary medical terminology databases
4. **Historical Patterns**: Learn from veterinarian-specific writing patterns

#### Data Management
1. **Persistent Storage**: Add a database layer for processed vaccination data
2. **Data Validation**: More sophisticated validation rules for medical data
3. **Audit Trail**: Track data processing history and confidence improvements
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates

#### User Experience
1. **Advanced Filtering**: Date ranges, vaccine types, veterinarian filters
2. **Data Export**: PDF reports, CSV exports for veterinary records
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Vaccination trends, coverage statistics
4. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for field use
5. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages

#### Production Features
1. **Authentication**: User management and role-based access
2. **Rate Limiting**: API protection and usage monitoring
3. **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and logging
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: API documentation and user guides

#### Technical Debt
1. **Error Boundaries**: More granular error handling
2. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and lazy loading
3. **Security**: Input sanitization and SQL injection protection
4. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG compliance for accessibility

## Deployment Considerations

### Hosting Platform
- **Recommended**: Vercel for seamless Next.js deployment
- **Database**: Continue using Supabase for managed PostgreSQL
- **CDN**: Automatic edge caching for static assets
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of API keys

### Performance Optimization
- **Build Optimization**: Tree shaking and code splitting
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for performance
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- **Database Indexing**: Add indexes for frequently queried fields

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a veterinary vaccination tracking system while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and scale.
